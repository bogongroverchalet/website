Join us and help keep the Bogong Rover Chalet thriving!

Working bee contributors receive free accommodation, and enjoy a great fun and
rewarding working bee experience :-)

We have a variety of tasks we undertake, and contributors can also look after
non-traditional tasks like the weekend catering :-) If you want to help we can
find you a rewarding job :-)

Everyone welcome and encouraged. Only seen the Chalet in winter? Learn how great
it is in summer too!
