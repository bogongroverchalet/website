title: Winter Interstater
---

A week at the Bogong Rover Chalet makes for the highlight of any Rover or
Venturer year.

We have a special [SA Venturer Ski
Week](http://qstore.sa.scouts.com.au/outdooradventure/alpine/) where we help you get
here and help sort out all your gear. [Book
now](http://qstore.sa.scouts.com.au/outdooradventure/alpine/).

All interstaters are welcome to all our other weeks as well!

Bring your whole Venturer Unit or Rover Crew to one of our weeks for the best
away activity ever; or come on your own, we're still really pumped to have you!
