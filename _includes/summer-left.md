#### Why come in summer

<div>
  <p>
    The Bogong Rover Chalet is a beautiful wilderness retreat in Victoria's high
    country.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's a beautiful setting to have a Group holiday, to have a planning
    weekend, to come hang out and help with one of our working bees, or just
    relax and watch the world go by.
