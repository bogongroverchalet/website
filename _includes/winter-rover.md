_The jewel of the Rover section._

The Bogong Rover Chalet is a owned and managed by the Rover section. And that
means we've made sure Rovers get the best experience.

Rovers have heaps of weeks open to them, with peak Ski conditions and an amazing
party environment.

Any Ski Week is open to Rovers, but our Ski Moots <i class='material-icons'
