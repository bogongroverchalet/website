## The Chalet

The Bogong Rover Chalet is unlike any other Chalet found on Australia's
Snowfields. It has a communal atmosphere where everyone pitches in to make the
Winter Party a success. Facilities include 240 volt generator power, fully
equipped kitchen and dining facilities, washing machine, drying room, toilets,
hot showers, and dormitories that include mattresses and pillows. The Bogong
Rover Chalet is located on the picturesque Bogong High Plains, an 11 kilometre
trip from the Falls Creek Ski Resort in Victoria's North East.
