## Getting to the Chalet

We all meet and stay the night in Mt Beauty the Friday night before our party
begins. We then ski into the Chalet on Saturday morning (day may vary for half
weeks).

**Note: For the 2022 season we be staying in the Mt Beauty Scout Hall on the
first night (rather than Tawonga as in the past).**

## Getting to Mount Beauty

Transport to Mount Beauty – It is each Winter Party member's responsibility for
their own transport to Mount Beauty. Contact your party leader and attend the
briefing night to arrange transport and carpooling. Your accommodation is at the
[Mt Beauty Scout Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/Sx9m2s9pAoFy8csd6).  (_Not Tawonga
for the 2022 season._) The cost is included in you winter party fee. Please
speak to your party leader if you will be there early – you may be asked to open
up the hall. If you are late, please be quiet.
