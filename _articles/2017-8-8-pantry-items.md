During winter we carry some fresh food in to the Chalet (meat and vegetables),
but then primarily eat food from the communal pantry.

The pantry needs to last the whole winter, so every party can only use their
share. This is managed by the Quartermaster for the week.

## Recipe book

the pantry - including their ingredient list - available for download
