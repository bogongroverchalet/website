During Winter the Bogong Rover Chalet runs a series of Ski Weeks (with the
occasional half week). This is due to the remote location of the Chalet.

Full weeks run from Saturday to Saturday (although exacts dates and times _may_
need to vary because of weather and safety requirements).

The full list of dates is available [here]({{ site.mainsite }}#winter-overview).

## Everyone's welcome

The Bogong Rover Chalet is available to members of the Scout Association and the
general public.

## Different age groups

During the season some Ski Weeks are restricted to different age groups.

Ski Venture weeks are open to Venturer aged participants, 15 - 18, with leaders
also attending for safety - not to do all of the work (or really any... :-p ).
Naturally, these are alcohol free weeks.

Our Ski Moot weeks are targeted at Rover aged participants, 18 - 26, with great
deals and a great party atmosphere for Rovers.

All our other weeks are open to everyone 18+.

## How it works

The normal run down of a week is as follows:

- A few weeks before the Ski Week, all participants attend a [Briefing
  Night](#briefing-night) - details are provided
- Friday night we all meet and sleep in [Tawonga](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Tawonga+Hall,+Tawonga+VIC+3697/@-36.6868208,147.1410288,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x6b2417adf98d5afb:0x71c2625a84776f38) (Venturers, we organise car pooling from Melbourne)
- Saturday morning we all head to [Falls Creek Coaches](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Falls+Creek+Coaches,+Tawonga+South+VIC+3698/@-36.7379858,147.1609871,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x6b243d96db96a74f:0xa74a0c7ad6694da1),
   park our cars (they're very nice and do a cheaper parking rate for Chalet
   participants), and get the bus up to [Falls Creek](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Windy+Corner+Car+Park,+Bogong+High+Plains+Rd,+Falls+Creek+VIC+3699/@-36.8645073,147.2864847,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x6b2447639a2dd45b:0x21aeee899c12bda5)
- From there we ski to the [Chalet](https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/Windy+Corner+Car+Park,+Bogong+High+Plains+Rd,+Falls+Creek+VIC+3699/Bogong+Rover+Chalet,+Nelse,+Victoria/@-36.884287,147.3048098,14z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m2!1m1!1s0x6b2447639a2dd45b:0x21aeee899c12bda5!1m2!1m1!1s0x6b2447ea5e2780c1:0xd9d7ac523322deeb!3e2) (it's 11km, so you must be fit enough to ski/hike that distance with your pack)
- We have a heap of fun, with everyone chipping in to help run the week (we
  split into duty groups to divide our basic chores)
- The following Saturday we, with great regret, pack up and leave; skiing back
  to Falls Creek before getting the Bus down again, and then driving back home.

## Getting to Tawonga

Everyone is expected to make their own way to Tawonga - although we make a
special point to help our Venturer aged participants.

We communicate as a group of participants before our Ski Week commences and to
organise things like carpooling.

## Briefing night

A few weeks before the Ski Week we have a Briefing Night with our Ski Party (all
the participants).

Here we talk about how everything works, what to expect, and answer any of your
questions.

It's a great way to meet everyone else in your Ski Party, and we also decide on
a theme for our week (just a bit of fun).
