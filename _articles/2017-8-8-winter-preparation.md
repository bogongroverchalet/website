## Before you get there

_Fitness_ - Being sufficiently fit will maximise your enjoyment of the winter
party. So get fit NOW! Useful exercises include stretching and any sort of
aerobic exercise such as running, jogging, cycling, swimming, skipping, aerobics
and walking.

_Ski Expo_ - Attend this entertaining evening that will allow you to purchase
ski clothing and Equipment at a discounted rate. 2nd Wednesday of June, at
Eastern Mountain Centre. You can organise ski hire on the night for pick up from
EMC or Ajays.

_Go Skiing_ - If the season allows it, get in some practice cross country
skiing. Practice carrying a heavier pack for a few hours both skiing and
walking.

## Ambulance cover

We highly recommend that you have full ambulance cover as skiing, either cross
country or downhill, is regarded as a high risk/extreme sport.

For those who have Private Health Insurance, your insurer may only cover you by
ambulance part of the way, one section or so many times per year.  Please check
your cover and make a decision accordingly.
