We know our Bogong skiers, hikers and bikers love our Bogong Rover Chalet
merchandise. Take a little Chalet Magic home with you from Bogong Alpine High
Plains with one of our fleece vests, Bogong woggles or even Bill's Book, a
history of Bogong Rover Chalet. You can replace your well-loved gear, add to
your Bogong collection, or be the first to get your hands on our new range of
merchandise for the ski season.

Bogong Chalet Management Group offers a range of merchandise exclusively
available for purchase at Bogong Rover Chalet, except for our annual online
orders in March. To keep our gear special, online orders are only open to those
who have experienced Bogong Rover Chalet.

Please bring cash with you if you wish to purchase merchandise during your visit
to Bogong Rover Chalet.  If you have any questions about our merchandise,
contact Bogong Rover Chalet or have a chat to your Winter Party Adviser.
