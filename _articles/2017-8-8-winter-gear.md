## Equipment checklist

Nothing will spoil your Winter Party more than having equipment that doesn't do
the job right. If you are not sure about anything ask your party leader. The
suggestions made in the following list have come from years of experience during
Winter Parties. If borrowing gear make sure that it fits correctly and is
serviceable. If hiring gear, explain why you need the equipment. Mention that it
is for the Bogong Rover Chalet, many staff at outdoor stores will know about the
Chalet. When choosing clothing go for wool, softshell, polar fleece, thermals
and similar. **Avoid cotton and denim.** Try your local disposal store for
cheaper items. If in any doubt, speak to your Party Leader.

## For Mt Beauty Scout Hall on Friday night

- Sleeping Bag
- Pillow (to be left in your car at Mount Beauty)

## For the trip into the Chalet

- Prepared lunch and energy food such as chocolate, muesli bars or scroggin.
- All your Ski Equipment – Cross-country skis, boots and poles. See other page
  for suggestions.
- All your equipment and clothing for the chalet in a pack.

## Pack, ski equipment, and other gear

**2021 warning: We believe there may be very high demand for hiring ski gear
this year. We suggest booking very very early (like, as soon as you read this)
for your ski hire for your ski week.** Skis booked as part of a package arranged
with the Chalet are locked in already.

_Pack_ – with ample hip belt and chest strap. Modern internally framed packs
with large hip belts to load weight onto the hips make carrying your load
easier. They are available for hire from an outdoor shop if necessary. Packs are
not one size fits all and need to be fitted properly. Some packs are
specifically designed for men or women

_Sleds are strictly prohibited, gear must be carried in a pack._

- _Water proofing_ - be sure to line your pack with a large plastic bag to keep
  everything dry. Pack your sleeping bag into another plastic bag. You can never
  have too many plastic bags.
- _Packing_ – Pack your sleeping bag at the bottom out of the way and heavier
  articles lower down and nearer your back. Put spare clothes that you may need
  nearer to the top or in the pockets. Nothing should be tied to the outside of
  your pack as it may be lost.

- _Load_ – Keep the weight down to about 15 kilograms including your allowance
  for fresh food, about 2 kilograms.
- _Extra Space at Top_ – All winter party members are expected to carry in a
  parcel of meat and fresh vegetables. Please bring plastic bags for this
  purpose.
- _Cross Country skis_ – suitable for medium to heavy touring with a pack. The
  use of some sort of retention strap is highly recommended to prevent runaway
  skis.
- _Cross Country Ski Boots_ – Either plastic or leather boots are recommended.
  For leather boots, a sturdier high cut boot is recommended.  Waterproof
  leather boots with 'Snoseal' or similar. (Do not use Dubbin as it softens the
  leather)
- _Cross Country Ski Poles_ – Any material is suitable. A larger basket for soft
  snow is recommended.
- _U.V. Sunglasses_ – with retention strap and ski goggles if desired.
- _Compass and Map of the area._
- _Beanie or Balaclava_
- _Peaked Cap_ – Optional
- _Coat_ - One of the most important items you'll be carrying. We recommend you
  use some sort of breathable such as 'Goretex' or 'Entrant', Japara or dry
  oilskin coats are also suitable. The coat should have ample hood. Most Alpine
  or Downhill Ski jackets are too hot for Cross Country Skiing. Cotton Lined
  Japaras should also be avoided along with full length riding 'Driazabone'
  coats, which are too heavy and hot for Cross Country Skiing.
- _Overpants_ – To be useful these must be water and wind proof
- _Woollen Jumper, Fibrepile or Polarfleece_
- _Woollen or Thermal shirt or skivvy_
- _Woollen or other appropriate trouser_ – High quality nylon tracksuit pants
  may be adequate. Avoid Cotton and Denim at all costs.
- _Socks_ – Woollen blends such as 'Explorers' are recommended. Pure wool and
  football socks can cause blisters. Many people wear 2 pairs of socks when
  wearing Ski Boots.
- _Gaiters_ – they keep the snow out of your boots.
- _Ski Gloves_ – bring a spare pair, overmitts are an advantage for woollen
  gloves. Using an older pair on the tow is suggested as it is wearing

### Clothing for the Chalet

- _Scout Uniform_ - minimum of Shirt and Scarf (don't forget your Alpine
  Venturer, Alpine Rover, or Bogong Rovers scarf if you have one)
- _Footwear_ - Light weight runners, Slippers or Surf sandals
- _Spare Clothes_ - a single set of clothes should suffice, there is a washing
  machine and powder is provided.

- _Sleeping Bag_ - the Chalet is quite warm but a good quality bag is advisable
  for emergencies.
- _Fitted Sheet_ - **to meet our COVID-Safe plan you _must_ bring a fitted sheet**
- _Pillow Slip and Inner Sheet_ - For hygiene reasons
- _Spare under wear_
- _Personal first aid kit_ - items you are likely to need including band aids,
  blister tape, 'Second Skin' headache tablets, knee brace etc.
- _Sweets, Chocolate or Scroggin_ - Watch the weight
- _Light weight water bottle_ - Approximately I litre.
