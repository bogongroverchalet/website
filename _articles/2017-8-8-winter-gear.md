## COVID requirements

**Bring five RATs and at least one mask.**

## Equipment checklist

Nothing will spoil your Winter Party more than having equipment that doesn't do
the job right. If you are not sure about anything ask your party leader. The
suggestions made in the following list have come from years of experience during
Winter Parties. If borrowing gear make sure that it fits correctly and is
serviceable. If hiring gear, explain why you need the equipment. Mention that it
is for the Bogong Rover Chalet, many staff at outdoor stores will know about the
Chalet. When choosing clothing go for softshell, polar fleece, wool, thermals
and similar. **Avoid cotton and denim.** If in any doubt, speak to your Party
Leader.

## For Mt Beauty Scout Hall on Friday night

- Sleeping Bag - if possible, a second one makes packing and departing easier,
  but is not necessary at all
- Pillow (to be left in your car at Mount Beauty)
- Sleeping Mat or Lilo (to be left in your car at Mount Beauty)
- Simple prepared breakfast (to be left in your stomach at Mount Beauty)
- Water to drink before departing - being well hydrated before starting is a
  great way to make life better

## For the trip into the Chalet

- Prepared lunch and energy food such as chocolate, muesli bars or scroggin -
  don't forget water.
- All your ski equipment – cross-country skis, boots and poles.
- All your equipment and clothing for the chalet in a pack.

## Pack, ski equipment, and other gear

_Note: for 2023 we will only be offering ski rental packages for Venturers, not
for any other type of booking. [Ajays](http://www.snow-ski.com.au) will continue
to offer a discounted rental rate to Rovers :-)_

_Pack_ – with ample hip belt and chest strap. Modern internally framed packs
with large hip belts to load weight onto the hips make carrying your load
easier. They are available for hire from an outdoor shop if necessary. Packs are
not one size fits all and need to be fitted properly. Some packs are
specifically designed for men or women.

_Sleds are strictly prohibited, gear must be carried in a pack._

- _Water proofing_ - be sure to line your pack with a large plastic bag to keep
  everything dry. Pack your sleeping bag into another plastic bag. You can never
  have too many plastic bags. Also a well fitting pack cover is good to have.
- _Packing_ – Pack your sleeping bag at the bottom out of the way and heavier
  articles lower down and nearer your back. Put spare clothes that you may need
  nearer to the top or in the pockets. Nothing should be tied to the outside of
  your pack as it may be lost.

- _Load_ – Keep the weight down below 15 kilograms including your allowance
  for fresh food, about 2 kilograms. First timers should especially focus on
  keeping weight down by avoiding unnecessary items e.g. bringing too many
  spares.
- _Extra space for food_ – All winter party members are expected to carry in a
  parcel of meat and fresh vegetables. Please bring plastic bags for this
  purpose.
- _Cross country skis_ – suitable for medium to heavy touring with a pack. The
  use of some sort of retention strap is highly recommended to prevent runaway
  skis (e.g. ski leashes). [See below](#skis-and-bindings) for more details if
  needed.
- _Cross country ski boots_ – Plastic boots are recommended, although some
  people prefer leather boots from their previous experience.
  For leather boots, a sturdier high cut boot is recommended. Waterproof
  leather boots with 'Snoseal' or similar. (Do not use Dubbin as it softens the
  leather)
- _Cross country ski poles_ – Any material is suitable. A larger basket for soft
  snow is recommended. Adjustable poles are nice, but not necessary.
- _U.V. Sunglasses_ – with retention strap, and ski goggles if desired. Most
  people prefer sunglasses for touring and have goggles for skiing the tow, and
  sometimes in particularly bad weather.
- _Compass and map of the area._
- _Beanie or balaclava_
- _Hat_ – Something to protect you from the sun in nicer weather.
- _Coat_ - One of the most important items you'll be carrying. We recommend you
  use some sort of breathable hard shell, such as a 'Goretex' or equivalent
  (e.g. another brand like 'eVent', or propietry fabrics from brands like
  Kathmandu). The coat should have ample hood. Most Alpine or Downhill Ski
  jackets are too hot for Cross Country Skiing. Cotton Lined Japaras should also
  be avoided along with full length riding 'Driazabone' coats, which are too
  heavy and hot for Cross Country Skiing.
- _Overpants_ – To be useful these must be water and wind proof. These are often
  generally available (and preferable) in similar fabrics like 'Goretex',
  'eVent' or per-brand equivalents.
- _Woollen jumper, polarfleece, or softshell Jacket_
- _Woollen or thermal shirt or skivvy_
- _Woollen or other appropriate trouser_ – High quality nylon tracksuit pants
  may be adequate. Avoid Cotton and Denim at all costs.
- _Socks_ – Woollen blends such as 'Explorers' are recommended. Pure wool and
  football socks can cause blisters. Many people wear 2 pairs of socks when
  wearing Ski Boots. Specific ski touring socks, or general skiing socks, are
  nice but aren't necessary (they can be pricey).
- _Gaiters_ – they keep the snow out of your boots.
- _Ski gloves_ – bring a spare pair, overmitts are an advantage for woollen
  gloves. We suggest using an older pair on the tow is suggested to avoid extra
  wear on nice (or soft) gloves
- _Ski helmet_ – A nice safe option whilst cross country skiing, and an
  essential safety item for skiing the tow.

### Clothing for the Chalet

- _Scout Uniform_ - minimum of Shirt and Scarf (don't forget your Alpine
  Venturer, Alpine Rover, or Bogong Rovers scarf if you have one)
- _Footwear_ - Light weight runners, Slippers or Surf sandals
- _Spare Clothes_ - a single set of clothes should suffice, there is a washing
  machine and powder is provided.

## Skis and bindings

Most people who visit the Bogong Rover Chalet use cross-country/telemark ski
gear. For example 75mm bindings, sometimes called Nordic Norm (_not_ New Nordic
Norm which are different), on patterned skis. If hiring, then this type of ski -
with metal edges - would be appropriate. Skis that are appropriate are also
sometimes referred to as XCD skis.

Shops that can assist with ski hire or purchase include: [Ajays and EMC
(Melbourne)](http://www.snow-ski.com.au), [The Wilderness Shop
(Melbourne)](https://www.wildernessshop.com.au/), [Rocky Valley (Mt
Beauty)](https://www.rockyvalley.com.au/snow-ski-hire-mount-beauty.html) and
[Cross Country Skier (Wodonga)](https://crosscountryskier.com.au/). Some of
these stores know the Chalet and saying you're "going to the Bogong Rover
Chalet" may be helpful.

### Things to say at a hire shop if you're struggling

I am going to the Bogong Rover Chalet, if you know it, it's about 11km from
Falls Creek on ungroomed trails and I'll be skiing with a pack. I'm looking for
75mm cable bindings on patterned skis with metal edges.

If this isn't enough detail for them, try the descriptions below:

- I'm looking for XCD skis with telemark bindings.
- Other people I'm skiing with use skis like: the Madshus Annum (formerly known
  as the Karhu Guide), the Fischer S-Bound 98 (or less commonly, the Fischer
  S-Bound 112 or 125), or the Rossignol BC 90 Positrack (or BC 80).
- Other people I'm skiing with use bindings like: G3 Targa or Voile Switchbacks.
  Some people use more premium options like the 22 Designs Axl or NTN bindings.
- Other people I'm skiing with use boots like: Scarpa T4 or Scott Excursions.

### Other ski and binding options

Some peopls use different ski and binding options when visiting the Chalet. If
this is your first time and you don't have much ski experience we suggest
sticking with the [above](#skis-and-bindings) suggestions.

These details are more appropriate for experienced skiers or experienced Chalet
attendees.

#### Binding options - telemark/cross country

_Note: These details are more appropriate for experienced skiers or experienced
Chalet attendees. **Stick with the [above](#skis-and-bindings) suggestions if
this is your first time skiing.**_

_NTN bindings_ - these are (generally speaking) comparable (_although not
compatible_) with 75mm bindings (and are often a higher quality option) and are
very appropriate for visiting the Chalet. The main drawback is the possible
increased cost.

_3 pin bindings_ - these are appropriate for any attendees, however they are
less popular than 75mm cable bindings due to their reduced boot support (which
makes them less friendly for stopping and turning). If in doubt we suggest 75mm
cable bindings in preference to 3 pin bindings - especially for beginners. They
are fine, but we suggest 75mm or NTN in preference to 3 pin.

_NNN bindings_ - these may be appropriate for the Chalet, but are generally not
recommended. They generally don't offer as much support - which is not what you
want (similar to the criticisms of 3 pin bindings). This lack of support is
particularly noticeable for beginners with packs. More experienced skiers who
want to progress their skiing may not like them as much because their lower
level of support is not good for learning to turn and brake with more
confidence. They are fine - but we suggest 75mm or NTN in preference to NNN.

#### Binding options - alpine touring

_Note: These details are more appropriate for skiers with some (downhill)
experience or experienced Chalet attendees. **Stick with the
[above](#skis-and-bindings) suggestions if this is your first time skiing.**_

If you have some downhill skiing experience, but no cross country experience,
then it would be worth considering the binding options in this section -
although they can be harder to hire (in particular with patterned skis). Using
cross country gear is still appropriate if you only have downhill experience
(it's our suggestion for first timers, so you should be fine).

_Dynafit/pin-style bindings_ - these are appropriate for the Chalet. You must
bring leashes if using this type of binding and they don't include a brake (most
don't). This type of binding is appropriate for experienced AT (alpine touring)
skiers. This type of binding may be appropriate for less experienced skiers who
have downhill experience - however we are not able to help with these bindings,
hence you must be compitent in using the bindings before arriving (e.g. having
done a practice weekend).

_Touring-centric resort-style AT bindings_ - these are appropriate for the Chalet.
Examples include Salomon Shifts or Marker Kingpins. These are backcountry AT
bindings which are focussed on touring/backcountry skiing, but can do double
duty skiing at a resort. These use pin toes and then a traditional downhill heel
(generally speaking). Again, we generally can't help with these bindings,
although they are simpler than Dynafit/pin-style bindings.

_Resort-style bindings with a touring mode_ - these are appropriate for the
Chalet. They're generally less efficient for the trip in and out, and for other
touring - but are workable. Again, we generally can't help with these bindings,
although they are simpler than Dynafit/pin-style bindings. A lot of people who
have used this type of binding decide they don't want to do it again and decide
to investigate the more touring-centric resort-style AT bindings (or
Dynafit/pin-style bindings). They're not as much fun for the touring, but can be
great fun on the tow.

#### Skis - patterned vs unpatterned

Patterned skis are strongly advised for the Chalet. They are much much more
enjoyable for the trip in/out, and for any touring.

We would strongly discourage any inexperienced tourers from considering using
unpatterned skis with skins for the trip in to the Chalet due to the extra
effort and frustration they can bring - especially if they ice up, which is not
uncommon in Australian conditions. It has been done, but a lot of people who use
unpatterned skis with skins decide to source patterned skis for future trips. If
you have experience with unpatterned skis and skins and are willing to travel a
long distance on them, then they are an option worth considering (including with
kicker skins).

#### Boots - telemark/cross country

Most people visiting the Chalet use plastic boots like the Scarpa T4 or Scott
Excursions. Some people use heavier boots, even up to 4-buckle boots like Scarpa
T1s. We don't suggest this as they are very heavy aren't ideal for touring, but
people do do it.

Some people use leather boots based on personal preference, and historically we
suggested these to beginners, but we don't suggest them any more as the world
has moved towards plastic boots.

#### Boots - alpine touring

_Note: These details are more appropriate for experienced skiers or experienced
Chalet attendees. **Stick with the [above](#skis-and-bindings) suggestions if
this is your first time skiing.**_

If you are going to use alpine touring gear to get to the Chalet then ensuring
you have appropriate boots is very important. Ensure you have boots with a
**good walk mode**. The people we know who have visited the Chalet in boots
without a walk mode have struggled and vowed never to do it again.

Boots like the Tecnica Cochise or Dalbello Lupo are a reasonable option for a
boot that is used at a resort but would also be acceptable (for most people) for
the trip to the Chalet.

Any touring-focussed AT (alpine touring) boot would work well.
