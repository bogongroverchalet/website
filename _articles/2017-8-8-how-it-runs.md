## Overview

The Bogong Rover Chalet is owned and run by the [Rover section](http://www.vicrovers.com.au/)
of the [Victorian Branch of Scouts Australia](http://scoutsvictoria.com.au/).

The Chalet is managed by the Bogong Chalet Management Group.

## The Bogong Chalet Management Group (BCMG)

The Bogong Chalet Management Group is responsible for managing the chalet.

The Management Group is made up of Rovers and members of the broader Scouting
community.

The members of the Management Group are nominated at our AGM, which is normally
hosted on the second Wednesday of October.

### Aims, Objectives and Operating Guidelines

The Bogong Chalet Management Group manage the Bogong Rover Chalet following the
[Aims, Objectives and Operating Guidelines](/uploads/operating_guidelines.pdf).

## Our Scout Groups

The Bogong Rover Chalet hosts a number of honorary Scout Groups.

### The Alpine Venturer Unit

The Alpine Venturer Unit was started during the winter season of the year 2000.

The Unit recognises attendance and participation at a Bogong Rover Chalet Ski
Venture.

#### Membership

Membership of the Alpine Venturer Unit is open to all Venturers. To qualify for
membership Venturers must:

- Be an invested Venturer
- Have completed one week at a Bogong Chalet Winter Party

### The Alpine Rover Crew

Established by W F "Bill" Waters during the winter of 1940, the Alpine Rover
Crew exists to provide an identity and sense of belonging for all those Rovers
and Scouters who participate in a winter party at the Bogong Rover Chalet.

Membership of the Crew is honorary and it does not hold any regular meetings.
Total membership numbers are unknown and the Crew survives simply as identity
and reminder to all that have skied at the Bogong Rover Chalet that they are
members of a large fellowship bound together by their shared experience.

#### Membership

Membership of the Alpine Rover Crew is open to all Scout Members over the age of 18.
To qualify for membership of the Crew Members must:

- Be an invested member of the Scout Association
- Have completed one week at a Bogong Chalet Winter Party

### The Bogong Rover Crew


The Bogong Rover Crew was established by W F "Bill" Waters and its first members
were invested into the Crew on Thursday 7th of September 1933.

Initially the Crew existed for the same purpose as the present Alpine Rover
Crew, however, this was changed in 1940 when the Alpine Rover Crew as a distinct
group came into existence.

From 1940 onwards the Bogong Rover Crew has existed as an award for outstanding
service and good conduct. The Crew has no permanent place nor wealth and
membership is strictly honorary. All those invested into the Bogong Rover Crew
are invested on skis during winter and insight of Mount Bogong, Victoria's
highest peak.

Those invested into the Crew in 1933 were;

W. F. "Bill" Waters
Harry Hewitt
H. E. "Bill" Williams
P. Batterham
G. Kemp
J.N. Gilchrist
C. Beeston
Roy Driver
E. Hulme

This picture shows the initial Bogong Rover Crew of 1933 outside Cope Hut on the
Bogong High Plains, Victoria.

Approximately two hundred and ten people have been invested into the Bogong
Rover Crew since its inception. In the near future we hope to provide details of
the full list of Crew members.

## Get involved

Due to the remote location, and all the snow, we need to do most of our
maintenance activities during the non-winter months.

We run a number of working bees during [Summer]({% article_url
visiting-in-summer %}#working-bees) and are grateful for any extra help
we can get!

Or get involved with the Bogong Chalet Management Group by attending our AGM and
joining.
