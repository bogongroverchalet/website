## Introduction

If this is your first time to the chalet (ever, or for a while), you
should aim for a pack weight of under 12kg, with an absolute max of
14kg. In addition to this, you will also need to carry *at least 1kg of
water and then also communal food for the week*. This will make your
pack noticeably heavier -- hence the low target weight.

*Note: Any items listed are mandatory/strongly encouraged unless marked
as optional.*

## Packing notes

- Don't tie anything to the outside of your pack -- the one exception
  may be a day pack if well strapped on (and nothing inside it)
- Keep heavy items at the middle (or bottom) of your pack, and closer
  to your back
- You will need extra space for communal food for the week, leave
  approximately five litres of space
  - If possible, keeping this food lower down and closer to your
    back is preferable for balance
- Ensure items you will use frequently, or in a hurry, are accessible:
  - Keep warm gloves near the top
  - Ensure your shell layers (jacket and pants) are accessible if
    weather changes, or can easily be put away if you get too warm
  - Keep a warm jacket near the top to put on when having breaks
  - Keep your water bottle somewhere you can access
  - Keep your scroggin accessible -- keep some in your pocket
  - Sunscreen -- sun reflected off snow is extra intense, so slip
    slop slap! And reapply!

## Friday night/Saturday morning

### Introduction

Friday night we stay at a community/Scout hall in Towonga or Mt Beauty.

You want to be able to leave everything you use Friday night in the cars
on Saturday morning because this allows you to have a fully packed bag
for the trip up, and means that Saturday morning can be stress free.
This isn't mandatory, but is certainly nicer.

Be prepared for the hall to be cold/cool.

### List

- Bag - to store any unused items during the week
- Sleeping mat
- Pillow
- Sleeping bag - a second one is preferable (but not mandatory) as it
  means your main one can be in your pack ready to go
- Breakfast for Saturday
  - *You must eat a nutritious meal to fuel yourself for the trip in*
  - Don't forget water to be well hydrated before we start -- the
    more you drink before you start, the less you need to carry --
    but don't skimp on what you carry
- Lunch for Saturday
  - *You must eat a nutritious meal to fuel yourself during the trip in*
- Ear plugs -- not mandatory, but people do snore
- Eye mask -- not mandatory, but people do turn lights on when they
  arrive
- A change of clothes for the final Saturday trip home

### Gear

### Introduction

Don't forget you can hire or borrow things, it's not necessary to buy
everything/anything.

- 50-60L is a good target size, if it's larger ensure you don't
  fill it
- Ensure it has a waterproof cover that won't blow away in wind,
  also waterproof the inside (e.g. using garbage bags)
- Needs to have a functional harness (waist belt and chest strap)
- Try it on and ensure it fits well

- Ski leashes -- these are really important as they stop your skis
  from disappearing
- Water bottle -- at least one litre. If using an insulated one, then
  filling it with warmed water is nice
  - Be cautious with bladders as they may freeze (e.g. the hose)
- Whistle
- Map and case
- Compass
- UHF radio -- optional but recommended, don't forget a lightweight
  charger and/or batteries
- PLB -- if you have access to one, it's a good emergency item to
  have. It would be your personal responsibility
- Space blanket and chemical warmers
- Personal first aid kit
  - Blister supplies
- Emergency toilet paper
- Scroggin/snacks -- these are important to keep your energy up. 500g is a good
  guide if unsure
- Head torch -- don't forget spare batteries or a charger
- Lighter/matches -- waterproof
- Daypack
  - 20-30L, light weight, with rain cover. At least 20L
  - Consider saving weight by using your main pack as a day pack --
    if doing this you'll need another bag to keep your items neat in
    the chalet, e.g. a sleeping bag storage bag
- Gaiters -- good idea, but generally not necessary with high cuffed
  plastic boots. Very necessary with low cuffed boots
- Whiteout cord - flouro brick layers cord is good
- Ski helmet -- optional, but recommended. We strongly recommend
  wearing a helmet if using the tow. They're also cosy and warm
- Sitting pad -- e.g. an offcut from a foam mat, or an inflatable one
- Liquid glide wide -- very optional, but nice to have in sticky snow
- Ski/binding repair kit -- may be coordinated with the whole winter
  week, confirm as a party
- Ski straps -- e.g. Voile straps (or similar), very optional, but
  useful -- e.g. if you need to put your skis on your pack (or carry
  them by hand), these can be useful for strapping them together
- Pocket knife/Leatherman/multitool

## Clothing/inside stuff

### Introduction

There is a washing machine and it will be run daily. There is also a
drying room. Clothing wise, less is more! Washing power is provided.

Don't forget, we have merch in the chalet too -- get yourself a new
jumper, and no need to ski it in! ðŸ˜‰

***You must not bring cotton or denim.***

### What you'll wear

- 1 x Thermal top
- 1 x Thermal legs
- 1 x Underwear
- 1 x Ski socks -- again, not cotton
- 1 x Mid layer -- e.g. fleece or merino jumper

### What you may wear depending on conditions -- needs to be accessible

- 1 x Ski touring/rain jacket
  - Avoid insulated downhill ski jackets, they're not good for
    layering and become impractical for touring as they are too warm
  - Look for Gore-tex, eVent, or other equivalents
  - A hood is necessary
- 1 x Overpants
  - Avoid insulated downhill ski pants, they're not good for
    layering and become impractical for touring
- 1 x Modesty shorts for over thermals on tours -- optional
- 1 x Warm jacket/layer -- e.g. a down jacket
- 1 x Beanie or balaclava
- 1 x Sun hat -- consider a cap in addition to a bucket style hat, as
  a cap fits under a hood
- 1 x Pair warm ski gloves/mittens -- e.g. downhill style. Even in
  warmer conditions these should be accessible for rest breaks
- 1 x Pair touring ski gloves -- similar to running gloves, your hands
  can get warm while touring
- 1 x Sunglasses -- the more coverage the better. Cycling style
  sunglasses are a good option
- 1 x Low contrast/clear sunglasses -- optional, but nice to have as
  eye cover when it's dull
- 1 x Goggles -- recommend, they're nice for rest breaks. Most people
  don't tour in goggles, but some choose to

  the chalet. Good for sun and wind
- 1 x Extra mid layer -- ensure you have good layering options

### List (in addition to above -- what will be in your pack)

- 1 x Sleeping bag -- doesn't need to be too warm, 0 degrees is
  usually plenty (unless you know you run particularly cold)
- 1 x Sleeping bag inner sheet -- optional
- 1 x Single mattress fitted sheet -- this is mandatory
- 1 x Pillowcase -- this is mandatory
- 1 x Pyjamas -- it's a communal environment, and the trip to the
  bathroom is cold
- 1 x Comfy pants -- can wear your pyjamas or shorts if you want to
  save some weight (although shorts may be a tad chilly)
- 2 x Comfy top/t-shirt
- 3 x Underwear

  - 1 x Tiny portion of moisturiser for sunburn and similar
  - Hair ties -- if needed
- Personal medical/care/first aid needs
- Sunscreen for the week

  you need to walk any of the trip to/from Falls Creek in preference
  to ski boots (which can be blister magnets)

- *Over 18 weeks only:* Up to 1.5kg of alcohol, move anything glass
  into a plastic bottle
- Ear plugs -- not mandatory, but people do snore

  and the sun can be glary in some rooms
- 5 x Rapid antigen tests -- in case of COVID, the combo tests (flu,
  etc) are preferable if possible

- Party night costume -- keep it light weight
  - If your pack is getting too heavy, leave it behind
  - Some little props can be used to jazz up some normal clothes

### What not to bring

- Books -- there's a library of books in the chalet
  - E-readers are a much better option if you have something you're
    actively reading
- Soft drink
  - You may choose to bring some soda stream flavours if you're well
    under the weight limit
  - There's plenty of cordial, including sugar free
- Glass bottles -- you need to carry them back out, as glass can't be
  left at the chalet
- Hair drier
- Hair straightener
- Makeup
- Pillow
- Full sized towel
- Driza-Bone
- The use of sleds (rather than a pack) is prohibited
- Downhill jacket/pants
