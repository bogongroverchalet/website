  A packing list for a trip to the Chalet. Don't take too much, but also don't
  skimp!

*Want to download this list? Here it is as a
[PDF](/downloads/Packing%20list%202023.pdf) or a
[Word doc](/downloads/Packing%20list%202023.docx).*

## Introduction

If this is your first time to the chalet (ever, or for a while), you
should aim for a pack weight of under 12kg, with an absolute max of
14kg. In addition to this, you will also need to carry *at least 1kg of
water and then also communal food for the week*. This will make your
pack noticeably heavier -- hence the low target weight.

*Note: Any items listed are mandatory/strongly encouraged unless marked
as optional.*

## Packing notes

* Don't tie anything to the outside of your pack -- the one exception
  may be a day pack if well strapped on (and nothing inside it)
* Keep heavy items at the middle (or bottom) of your pack, and closer
  to your back
* You will need extra space for communal food for the week, leave
  approximately five litres of space

  * If possible, keeping this food lower down and closer to your
    back is preferable for balance
* Ensure items you will use frequently, or in a hurry, are accessible:

  * Keep warm gloves near the top
  * Ensure your shell layers (jacket and pants) are accessible if
    weather changes, or can easily be put away if you get too warm
  * Keep a warm jacket near the top to put on when having breaks
  * Keep your water bottle somewhere you can access
  * Keep your scroggin accessible -- keep some in your pocket
  * Sunscreen -- sun reflected off snow is extra intense, so slip
    slop slap! And reapply!

## Friday night/Saturday morning

Friday night we stay at a community/Scout hall in Towonga or Mt Beauty.

You want to be able to leave everything you use Friday night in the cars
on Saturday morning because this allows you to have a fully packed bag
for the trip up, and means that Saturday morning can be stress free.
This isn't mandatory, but is certainly nicer.

Be prepared for the hall to be cold/cool.

- 50-60L is a good target size, if it's larger ensure you don't fill it - Ensure it has a waterproof cover that won't blow away in wind, also waterproof the inside (e.g. using garbage bags) - Needs to have a functional harness (waist belt and chest strap) - Try it on and ensure it fits well

## Clothing

There is a washing machine and it will be run daily. There is also a
drying room. Clothing wise, less is more! Washing power is provided.

Don't forget, we have merch in the chalet too -- get yourself a new
jumper, and no need to ski it in! 😉

***You must not bring cotton or denim.***

### What not to bring

* Books -- there's a library of books in the chalet

  * E-readers are a much better option if you have something you're
    actively reading
* Soft drink

  * You may choose to bring some soda stream flavours if you're well
    under the weight limit
  * There's plenty of cordial, including sugar free
* Glass bottles -- you need to carry them back out, as glass can't be
  left at the chalet
* Hair drier
* Hair straightener
* Makeup
* Pillow
* Full sized towel
* Driza-Bone
* The use of sleds (rather than a pack) is prohibited
* Downhill jacket/pants
* No more than one pair of spare shoes/slippers

**If you have any doubts, questions or concerns regarding equipment contact your
party leader or the bookings officer on 0407 242 538**
