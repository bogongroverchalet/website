## Health forms

All participants will need to provide a current health statement at the start of

Information Record downloaded from Scouts Victoria.

## Privacy notice

You agreed to us collecting personal and sensitive data for the purposes
disclosed in our Privacy Policy. In the case of a youth member, you acknowledge
a similar understanding and agreement in your capacity as the Parent or Guardian
of that member. Individuals have the right to access any personal information
which Scouts Victoria holds about them and advise Scouts Victoria of any
perceived inaccuracy. Any enquiries, complaints and requests for access can be
made to the address listed in the Privacy Policy.

You acknowledge that you have read this Privacy Notice and hereby reaffirm your
understanding of the Branch Privacy Policy and your continuing agreement to the
collection of personal and sensitive data for the purposes disclosed in that
Policy.

## Digital media

Please note any photos taken at Chalet events may be shared publicly or used for
promotional material.  If, for any reason, you do not wish to give consent to
your child’s or your own image being used on social media or in promotional
material please email
[bookings@bogongroverchalet.org.au](mailto:bookings@bogongroverchalet.org.au)
and ensure that the leaders in your group are aware of this. Additionally ensure
that anyone taking photos is aware, as it is very easy to take and share.

## Insurance note

The Chalet only provides minimal personal property insurance. Participants to
winter parties should ensure that they have the appropriate level of insurance
for their personal property through their House and Contents Insurance, or
Travel Insurance.

The Chalet recommends that all attendees hold a current ambulance service
membership. Private health insurance does not always cover the full cost of
ambulance transport. Falls Creek Medical Centre is a private health care
provider. Out of pocket expenses may apply if you are treated at Falls Creek
even in a medical emergency.

## Winter party capacity

The Chalet capacity is 35 per night. The BCMG reserves the right to limit
numbers to less than this, and may appoint Nobs/Leaders to the Winter Party from
outside the bookings pool.

Winter parties require a minimum of ten participants to run.

## Waiting lists

These will be available for all Winter Parties.  When a week books out we start
a waiting list. Participants on the waiting list will be contacted in order of
application when spaces become available. Guarantee your booking by attending a
week which has space, but if you can't we advise joining the waiting list as we
often have spaces opening up - e.g. spaces that may have been reserved for Nobs
(attendees who have done training and are there to help facilitate the week)
that are filled from existing participants, or the waiting list. To join the
waiting list, send an email to
[bookings@bogongroverchalet.org.au](mailto:bookings@bogongroverchalet.org.au)
indicating which week you want.

## Damage

If any damage is done, please notify the Warden or Bookings Office asap. Please
call before trying to fix or improve anything yourselves.

You may be liable for the cost of damage incurred if you fail to disclose
relevant information, were negligent, or willfully caused damage.
