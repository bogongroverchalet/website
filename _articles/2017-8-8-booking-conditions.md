_Note, winter parties require a minimum of ten participants to run._


## COVID-19 Situation

We will be operating to a maximum capacity in line with the Victorian Government
Covid-Safe restrictions and Scouts Victoria's Covid policy. We are currently
restricted to a capacity of 30 (at 27 Jan 2022) and if restrictions change, we
will increase or decrease our capacity in line with Government restrictions and
Scouts Victoria policy.  In the event of our capacity being reduced, bookings
will be cancelled on a last in, first out basis.  These participants will be
offered a transfer to another week or put on the waiting list for that week.  If
anyone has to withdraw from a winter party at anytime prior to commencement due
to Covid-19 (sickness, unwell, travel restrictions & capacity restriction) the
BCMG will process a full refund.

## Winter Party Withdrawal

 - Refunds may be applied for in writing addressed to the BCMG.
 - Please contact the bookings officer as soon as you discover you may not be
   able to go to your winter party to discuss the issue.
 - There may be a waiting list so substitution is not permitted.
 - Withdrawals received more than 1 month prior to winter party will receive a
   90% refund.
 - Withdrawals received less than 1 month prior to winter party will incur a
   $100 penalty.
 - The BCMG reserves the right to determine refunds on a case by case basis.
 - In the event of failure to attend the commencement of your winter party or
   withdrawal during your winter party because of evacuation due to illness or
   injury, there will be no refund available.

## Photos

 - Please note any photos taken at Chalet events may be shared publicly or used
   for promotional material. If, for any reason, you do not wish to give consent
   to your child’s or your own image being used on social media or in
   promotional material please email
   [bogongchalet@vicscouts.com.au](mailto:bogongchalet@vicscouts.com.au) and
   ensure that the leaders in your group are aware of this. Additionally ensure
   that anyone taking photos is aware, as it is very easy to take and share.
