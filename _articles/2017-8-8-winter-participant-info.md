    your pack and sleeping bag do so.  Do not pack your bag before leaving - it
    should already be packed.
  - Wait at the Syphon to be told what to do. The Party Leader and Quarter
    Master will look after you and account for everyone.
  - If you have an emergency on a tour – listen to your Trip Leader as it is
    their responsibility to deal with any situation that arises.
  - Do everything that you can to assist and make things easier.
